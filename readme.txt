NTADS (NTADS2) was created so I could uses Delphi to interact with Active
Directory.
This work was originally just meant for me and the code may be dirty here and
there but for the most part it does work.  I am sure there is great room for
improvement.

If you do use NTADS in your applications I would certainly appreciate a mention
in your "About" dialog.

The original component was developed with D6 and later used in D2005.  I did
update it when D2009 came out but I have not done anywork to change anything to
use some of the newer methods that D2009 or XE/2 has.

This has been tested up through Delphi Tokyo.

Please let me know if you find any files are missing and I will add them as soon as possible.
